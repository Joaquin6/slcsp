I wrote the application on Node server.
It is running on the latest stable version of node, v6.10.1
NPM version used, v3.10.10

Make sure you have the latest stable version of Node installed.
I developed on a MAC so im not too clear on the possible bugs on a windows machine.

To get started, it is as simple as running the following command in your terminal:

	npm i && npm start
