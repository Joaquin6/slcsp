I wrote the application on Node server.
It is running on the latest stable version of node, v6.12.3

Make sure you have the latest stable version of Node installed.
I developed on Ubuntu so im not too clear on the possible bugs on a windows machine.

To get started, it is as simple as running the following command in your terminal:

	npm start
